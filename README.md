# Seq2Seq-Prediction
This is the code implementation for our 2021+ PSE conference paper "Continuous Manufacturing Process Sequential Prediction using Temporal Convolutional Network".

## Model
We have implemented recurrent neural networks (***rnn.py***,***lstm.py***), temporal convolutional netwrok(***TCN.py***),and modified transformer/informer models(***transformer.py***,***informerT1.py***,***informerT2.py***).

## Dataset
We provided a dataset from a sintering process. If you want to retrain the model with your own data, you can use the ***class Dataset_custom***
